Terraform: Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

⦁	What it is: Terraform is a popular, cloud-agnostic Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool created by HashiCorp.

⦁	Core Purpose: It allows you to define and provision cloud infrastructure (like AWS EC2, VPC, S3) using human-readable code (.tf files) instead of manual console clicks.

⦁	Language: It uses HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language), which is simple, declarative, and similar to JSON.

⦁	Key Workflow: The standard workflow involves terraform init (initialize), terraform plan (preview changes), and terraform apply (create/update resources).

⦁	Benefits: It enables consistency, automation, version control for your infrastructure, and the ability to easily create/destroy environments to save costs.
